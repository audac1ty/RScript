# RScript

This install.sh script allows the user to FINALLY install the cran odbc driver against R studio over HDInsight.

# "But why?"

Because HDInsight hasn't updated to version 3.4 of R studio and the makeconf doesn't accept the flags that tell it to compile properly.

# "Isn't that silly?"

Yes, very. But we managed to fix it.

# "Can I use this?"

Of course, but it's super janky.

# "Who's the man?"

I'm da man.
